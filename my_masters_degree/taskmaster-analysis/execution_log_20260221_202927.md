# Execution Log - Taskmaster-1 EDA
**Date:** 2026-02-21 20:29:27
**Task:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Taskmaster-1 (2019) Dataset

## Deviations from Original Plan

### 1. Data Loading Strategy
**Original Plan:** Load dataset using `load_dataset("google-research-datasets/taskmaster1")`.
**Issue:** The Hugging Face `datasets` library no longer supports arbitrary Python loading scripts (`taskmaster1.py`) for security/maintenance reasons. The initial attempt failed with `trust_remote_code` warnings and errors.
**Resolution:**
- Investigated the original `taskmaster1.py` script to find the source data URLs.
- Refactored the script to use `load_dataset("json", data_files=...)` pointing directly to the raw JSON files hosted on the Google Research GitHub repository:
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research-datasets/Taskmaster/master/TM-1-2019/self-dialogs.json`
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research-datasets/Taskmaster/master/TM-1-2019/woz-dialogs.json`

### 2. Dependency Management
- Added `seaborn` to the project dependencies using `uv add seaborn` to support enhanced visualizations.
- Verified that `datasets`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` were already available in the environment.

## Execution Summary

The script `my_masters_degree/taskmaster-analysis/eda_taskmaster_hf.py` was successfully executed. It downloaded the data, processed the JSON structures, and generated the following artifacts in `my_masters_degree/taskmaster-analysis/results/`:

### Key Statistics
- **Total Dialogues:** 13,215
- **Mean Turns per Dialogue:** 22.93
- **Median Turns per Dialogue:** 21.00

### Speaker Distribution
- **ASSISTANT:** 156,971 utterances
- **USER:** 146,040 utterances
- **Unknown:** 55 utterances

### Visualizations Generated
1.  `distribuicao_turnos.png`: Histogram showing the frequency of dialogue lengths (turns).
2.  `distribuicao_speakers.png`: Bar chart visualizing the balance between User and Assistant turns.
